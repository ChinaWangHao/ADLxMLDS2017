The repository is made to keep my works for the course: [Applied Deep Learning / Machine Learning and Having It Deep and Structured (2017 Fall)](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/f106-adl/index.html), held by Prof. [Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) and Prof. [Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/), National Taiwan University.
### About the Course
Learning the basic theory of deep learning and how to apply to various applications.


## Brief Description
- **hw1: Sequence labeling using RNN and CNN.** Input a frame-level speech sequence and output a phone sequence.
- **hw2: Video captioning using seq2seq model and attention mechanism.** Input a video and output captions of the video.
- **hw3: Game playing using deep reinforcement learing.** Implement REINFORCE and DQN agents for Atari-games.
- **hw4: Conditional image genearation using DCGAN.** Output images conditioning on the discription of the text.

## Environment
`Python 3.5.3` 
`tensorflow 1.3.0` 
`Keras 2.0.8`
