The repository is made to keep my works for the course: [Applied Deep Learning / Machine Learning and Having It Deep and Structured (2017 Fall)](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/f106-adl/index.html), held by Prof. [Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) and Prof. [Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/), National Taiwan University.
### About the Course
Learning the basic theory of deep learning and how to apply to various applications.

### Brief Description
- hw1: **Sequence labeling using RNN and CNN.** Output a phone sequence based on a frame-level speech sequence input.
- hw2: **Video captioning using seq2seq model and attention mechanism.** Output captions based on video features (VGG-16).
- hw3: **Game playing using deep reinforcement learing.** Implement REINFORCE and DQN agents to learn and play Atari-games.
- hw4: **Conditional image genearation using DCGAN.** Output images conditioning on the discription of given text.

### Environment
`Python 3.5.3` 
`tensorflow 1.3.0` 
`Keras 2.0.8`
`scikit-learn 0.19.0`
