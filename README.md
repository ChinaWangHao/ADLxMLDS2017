# ADLxMLDS2017
The repository is made to keep my works for the course: Applied Deep Learning / Machine Learning and Having It Deep and Structured (2017 Fall), held by Prof. Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen and Prof. Hung-Yi Lee, National Taiwan University.

## About the Course
Learning the basic theory of deep learning and how to apply to various applications.

## Brief Description
hw1: Sequence labeling using RNN and CNN. Input a frame-level speech sequence and output a phone sequence.
hw2: Video captioning using seq2seq model and attention mechanism. Input a video and output captions of the video.
hw3: Game playing using deep reinforcement learing. Implement REINFORCE and DQN agents for Atari-games.
hw4: Conditional image genearation using Generative Adversarial Network. Input ceretain text and output images conditioning on the discription of the text.
